# A Breakdown of SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Description

The motivation behind creating this project was to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. In this case, a content management system (CMS).

This project was built as a command-line application to view departments, roles and employees within a certain company. This application allows a user to add departments, roles and employees as needed and even update an employee, as well.

This project is an easy to use application that keeps a company's employer data in one easy to read place.

This project delves into queries with mySQL and how to display data using the inquirer package.
